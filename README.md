# Python

## my collection of self-educational coils of Python

This repository is based on the assumption that [Python](https://www.python.org/) will continue to be the core of data science stacks for a large time.

Additionally, as a years-long aspiring _daily_ user of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-11/), my work with Python promises to encourage me to jump into Blender [scripting](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/scripting/introduction.html) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks (`*.ipynb`).

## setup (Windows 10)

The python [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/python/3.6.4.20180116) from Python Software Foundation is the basis of the setup. Then, for my Visual Studio Code environment, “[I follow Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).”

I am aware that I might want to start with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) but, for now, will continue the play the role of macho developer.

## setup (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)

[A Blog post from Rose Web Services](https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-python-3-6-on-ubuntu-16-04/) shows me this:

```bash
apt-get install python3.6
which python3.6
python3.6 --version
```
