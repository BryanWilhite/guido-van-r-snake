# Python

## my collection of self-educational coils of Python

This repository is based on the assumption that [Python](https://www.python.org/) will continue to be the core of data science stacks for a large time.

Additionally, as a years-long aspiring _daily_ user of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-11/), my work with Python promises to encourage me to jump into Blender [scripting](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/scripting/introduction.html) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
