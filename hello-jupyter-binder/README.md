After hearing about mybinder.org on _[Episode #44: Project Jupyter and IPython](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/44/project-jupyter-and-ipython)_ of `TalkPython['Podcast']`, my curiosity—which is quite limited—should be satisfied.

My number-one reason to use something like mybinder.org is to share _live_ notebooks from a server that supports _multiple_ kernels or at least the _latest_ flavor of python. As of this writing mybinder.org does none of these things.

I had sincerely assumed that mybinder.org would be ahead of [Microsoft’s Azure Notebooks](http://notebooks.azure.com) (which supports Python 3.6, F# and R). Today this is not the case.
